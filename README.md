# svelte-pdf-highlighter

Work in progress

Fork of [`react-pdf-highlighter-extended`](https://github.com/DanielArnould/react-pdf-highlighter-extended)

`svelte-pdf-highlighter` is a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) library that provides a highly customisable annotation experience for PDF documents on the web, with text and rectangular highlights both supported. It leverages [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) as its viewer. The highlight data format is also independent of the viewport, making it suitable for saving on a server.
